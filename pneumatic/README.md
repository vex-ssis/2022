# Pneumatic in VEX

We have one set with a 100 psi pressure cylinder and 2 single-action pistons with feather for return. The system was tested at the end of May 2022.

You have to use one of the 3-pin connectors as digital output. We wrote [a program](https://github.com/vex-ssis/2022/blob/main/pneumatic/pneumatic3.v5python) that opens the valve for a second and closes it for a second and prints the counter on the display.
